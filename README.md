# Navigation System User Guide

## Overview

This project implements a simple navigation system using Python. It models a network of locations connected by roads and allows for visualizing the road network. The system can be extended to include various algorithms, such as shortest path algorithms or route optimizations.

## Features

- **Locations**: The system includes a set of locations (nodes) such as City Center, University Campus, Industrial Zone, and more.
- **Road Network**: Roads (edges) are defined between locations with associated costs (distance/time).
- **Visualization**: The system can visualize the entire road network, helping users understand the connections and distances between various locations.
- **Modularity**: The system is modular, allowing for easy additions or modifications of locations and roads.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
    - `matplotlib` (for visualizing the road network)
    - `networkx` (for managing the graph structure)
    - Any other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if applicable)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/navigation-system.git
   cd navigation-system
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Navigation System

To run the system and visualize the road network, use the following steps:

1. Make sure your environment is set up (dependencies installed).
2. Run the `main.py` script or directly run the code from a Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Alternatively, you can execute the script in a Jupyter notebook cell.

### How the System Works

- **Locations**: Locations are added to the system with an associated cost (e.g., `City Center`, `North District`, etc.).
  
- **Roads**: Roads connect these locations, and each road has a defined distance. For example, there is a road from `City Center` to `North District` with a distance of 15 km.

- **Visualization**: When you run the script, the road network will be visualized using `matplotlib`, showing nodes (locations) and edges (roads) with distances.

## Example

Here is an example of how the locations and roads are defined in the system:

```python
locations = {
    0: ("City Center", 2.0),
    1: ("North District", 1.5),
    2: ("Business Park", 1.0),
    # Add more locations...
}

road_conditions = [
    (0, 1, 15),  # Road from City Center to North District with distance 15 km
    (0, 2, 22),  # Road from City Center to Business Park with distance 22 km
    # Add more roads...
]
```

## Visualizing the Road Network

The road network is displayed as a graph, with nodes representing locations and edges representing roads. You can customize the visual appearance using `matplotlib` for better clarity.

## Customizing the System

You can easily add or modify locations and roads. Hereâ€™s how to add a new location:

```python
nav.add_location(new_node, "New Location", cost)
```

To add a road between two locations:

```python
nav.add_road(start_node, end_node, distance)
```

You can also modify the algorithm or visual representation as needed.
